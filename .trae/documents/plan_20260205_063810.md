Based on your clarification, I will modify the plan to implement audio start and end time segments (clipping) instead of a global duration limit.

### **1. Configuration Update (`src/config.ts`)**
- Update the `gallery` items and `loveLetter` object to include new fields:
    - `audioStartTime`: The timestamp (in seconds) where playback should begin.
    - `audioEndTime`: The timestamp (in seconds) where playback should loop or stop.
- This allows precise control over which part of the song plays (e.g., skipping a slow intro).

### **2. Audio Logic Update**
- **Files**: `src/pages/SwipeGallery.tsx` and `src/pages/LoveLetter.tsx`
- **Implementation**:
    - **Initialization**: When the audio loads, immediately set `audio.currentTime` to `audioStartTime`.
    - **Looping/Monitoring**: Add a `timeupdate` event listener. When `audio.currentTime` reaches `audioEndTime`, reset it back to `audioStartTime` (creating a seamless loop of the selected segment).
    - **Fallback**: If no start/end times are provided, it will default to playing the full track.

### **3. Image Optimization (SwipeGallery.tsx)**
- **Switch to `<img>` tag**: Replace `backgroundImage` with an `<img>` tag to improve priority handling and accessibility.
- **Preloading**: Implement logic to preload the *next* image in the gallery sequence to prevent loading delays during swiping.

I will now update the configuration and components to support these specific audio segments and image optimizations.
